# Introduction
**Production Grade Image for PHP 7+ Applications** running **Nginx + PHP FPM** based on [PHP](https://hub.docker.com/_/php) & [Nginx](https://hub.docker.com/_/nginx) **Official Images**, compatible with popular PHP Frameworks such as [Laravel 5+](https://laravel.com/) & [Symfony 4+](https://symfony.com/) and their variants.

- This is a pre-configured template image for your PHP Application, **and you shall extend and edit it according to your app requirements.** (instructions below)
- The Image utilizes multistage builds to create multiple targets optimized for **production** and **development** usecases.
- Image designed to be run in Kubernetes.
- Supports PHP applications that uses a single-entrypoint framework in `public/index.php`, such as Laravel, Symfony, and all their variants.

## Features üìú

- Designed to run in orchestrated environments like Kubernetes.
- Uses Alpine based images and multistage builds for minimal images. (~130 MB)
- Multi-Container setup with `Nginx` & `PHP-FPM` communicating via TCP.
- Productions Image that are **immutable** and **fully contained**.
- **Runs as non-root** in both application containers.
- Configured for graceful shutdowns/restarts, **zero downtime deployments, auto-healing, and auto-scaling**.
- Easily extend the image with extra configuration, and scripts; such as post-build & pre-run scripts.
- Minimal startup time, container almost start serving requests almost instantly. 
- Image tries to fail at build time as much as possible by running all sort of checks.
- Ability to run Commands, Consumers and Crons using same image. (No supervisor or crontab)
- Development Image **supports mounting code and hot-reloading and XDebug**.

## How to use with my project ?

- Copy this repository `Dockerfile`, `docker` Directory, `Makefile`, and `.dockerignore` to your application root directory and configure it to your needs.

## How to configure image to run my project ?

You'll need to iterate over your application's dependency system packages, and required PHP Extensions; and add them to their respective locations in the image. 

1. Add System Dependencies and PHP Extensions your application depends on to the Image.
2. Port in any configuration changes you made for PHP.ini to the image, otherwise use the sane defaults.
3. `make build && make up` for development setup, `make deploy` to run the production variant.

These steps explained in details below.

## How is it deployed ?

Your application will be split into two components.

1. **The Webserver** -> Server Static Content and proxy dynamic requests to PHP-FPM over TCP, webserver also applies rate limiting, security headers... and whatever it is configured for.
2. **The PHP Process** -> PHP FPM process that will run you PHP Code.

> Other type of deployments such as a cron-job, or a supervised consumer can be achieved by overriding the default image CMD. 

-----

# Requirements 

- [Docker 20.05 or higher](https://docs.docker.com/install/) 
- [Docker-Compose 1.27 or higher](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (optional)
- PHP >= 7 Application

# Setup

#### 1. Add Template to your repo.

1. Download This Repository
2. Copy `Dockerfile`, `docker` Directory, `Makefile`, and `.dockerignore` Into your Application Repository.

OR

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16992394/133710871-178f9cb6-922e-41e1-9c69-dff8f9773b97.png" alt="create repository from template"></a>

#### 2. Start
1. Modify `Dockerfile` to your app needs, and add your app needed OS Packages, and PHP Extensions.
    1. Dockerfile Header has Build Time Arguments, customize it, most notably the `RUNTIME_DEPS` argument.
    2. Below in the `base` image, add the PHP Extensions your application depends on.
2. Run `make up` for development or `make deploy` for production.
    1. For Dev: `make up` is just an alias for `docker-compose up -d`
    1. For Dev: Make sure to delete previous `vendor` directory if you had it before.
    2. Docker-Compose will start App container first, and only start Web server when it's ready, on initial install, it might take some time.
4. Go to [http://localhost](http://localhost:8080) 

> Makefile is just a wrapper over docker-compose commands.
      
## Building, Configuring and Extending Image 

### Image Targets and Build Arguments
- The image comes with a handy _Makefile_ to build the image using Docker-Compose files, it's handy when manually building the image for development or in a not-orchestrated docker host.
However, in an environment where CI/CD pipelines will build the image, they will need to supply some build-time arguments for the image. (tho defaults exist.)
    
    #### Build Time Arguments
    | **ARG**            | **Description**                                                                                                                                      | **Default** |

    #### Image Targets
    
    | **Target** | Env         | Desc                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Size   | Based On                      |
    |------------|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|-------------------------------|
    | app        | Production  | The PHP Application with immutable code/dependencies. By default starts `PHP-FPM` process listening on `9000`.  Command can be extended to run any PHP Consumer/Job, entrypoint will still start the pre-run setup and then run the supplied command.                            | ~135mb | PHP Official Image (Alpine)   |
    | web        | Production  | The webserver, an Nginx container that is configured to server static content and forward dynamic requests to the PHP-FPM container running in the `app` image variant                                                                                                           | ~21mb  | Nginx Official Image (Alpine) |
    | app-dev    | Development | Development PHP Application variant with dependencies inside. Image expects the code to be mounted on `/app` to support hot-reloading. You need to mount dummy `/app/vendor` volume too to avoid code volume to overwrite dependencies already inside the image. | ~150mb | PHP Official Image (Alpine)   |
    | web-dev    | Development | Development Webserver with the exact configuration as the production configuration. Expects public directory to be mounted at `/app/public`                                                                                                                              |    ~21mb     |   Nginx Official Image (Alpine)                            |

### Install System Dependencies and PHP Extensions
- The image is to be used as a base for your PHP application image, you should modify its Dockerfile to your needs.

    1. Install System Packages in the following section in the Dockerfile.
        - List OS Packages needed in `RUNTIME_DEPS` ARG in Dockerfile header.
    2. Install PHP Extensions In the following section in the Dockerfile.
    ```dockerfile
    # ---------------------------------------- Install / Enable PHP Extensions ---------------------------------------------
    RUN docker-php-ext-install \
    opcache     \
    intl        \
    pdo_mysql   \
    # Pecl Extentions
    RUN pecl install apcu-5.1.20 && docker-php-ext-enable apcu
    #   EX: RUN pecl install memcached && docker-php-ext-enable memcached
    ```
##### Note
> At build time, Image will run `composer check-platform-reqs` to check that PHP and extensions versions match the platform requirements of the installed packages.

### PHP Configuration
1. PHP `base` Configuration that are common in all environments in `docker/php/base-php.ini`[üîó](https://github.com/sherifabdlnaby/kubephp/blob/master/docker/php/base-php.ini) 
1. PHP `prod` Only Configuration  `docker/php/php-prod.ini`[üîó](https://github.com/sherifabdlnaby/kubephp/blob/master/docker/php/prod-php.ini) 
2. PHP `dev` Only Configuration  `docker/php/php-dev.ini`[üîó](https://github.com/sherifabdlnaby/kubephp/blob/master/docker/php/dev-php.ini) 

### PHP FPM Configuration
1. PHP FPM Configuration  `docker/fpm/*.conf` [üîó](https://github.com/sherifabdlnaby/kubephp/blob/master/docker/fpm)

### Nginx Configuration
1. Nginx Configuration  `docker/nginx/*.conf && docker/nginx/conf.d/* ` [üîó](https://github.com/sherifabdlnaby/kubephp/blob/master/docker/nginx)

## Post Build and Pre Run optional scripts.

In `docker/` directory there is `post-build-*` and `pre-run-*` scripts that are used **to extend the image** and add extra behavior.

1. `post-build` command runs at the end of Image build.
   
    Run as the last step during the image build. Are Often framework specific commands that generate optimized builds, generate assets, etc.
   
2. `pre-run` command runs **in runtime** before running the container main command
   
    Runs before the container's CMD, but after the composer's post-install and post-autload-dump. Used for commands that needs to run at runtime before the application is started. Often are scripts that depends on other services or runtime parameters.

3. `*-base` scripts run on both `production` and `development` images.

# Misc Notes
- Your application [should log app logs to stdout.](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38499825/symfony-logs-to-stdout-inside-docker-container). Read about [12factor/logs](https://12factor.net/logs) 
- By default, `php-fpm` access logs are disabled as they're mirrored on `nginx`, this is so that `php-fpm` image will contain **only** application logs written by PHP.
- In **production**, Image contains source-code, however, you must sync both `php-fpm` and `nginx` images so that they contain the same build.

--------

# FAQ

1. Why two containers instead of one ?

    -  In containerized environment, you need to only run one process inside the container. This allows us to better instrument our application for many reasons like separation of health status, metrics, logs, etc.

2. Image Build Fails as it try to connect to DB.
    
    - A typical application in most Frameworks comes with `Doctrine` ORM, Doctrine if not configured with a DB Version, will try to access the DB at php's script initialization (even at the post-install cmd's), and it will fail when it cannot connect to DB. [Make sure you configure doctrine to avoid this extra DB Check connection.](https://symfony.com/doc/current/reference/configuration/doctrine.html#:~:text=The-,server_version,-option%20was%20added)

3. Xdebug not working

    - Xdebug is configured to work with Linux, to make it work for Mac/Windows, please change Xdebug config in `/docker/php/dev-xdebug.ini` >> `xdebug.client_host` to `host.docker.internal`.
